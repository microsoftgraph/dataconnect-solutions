# GroupMembers_v0 dataset

The GroupMembers_v0 dataset generates a list of direct members of all groups. A group can have users, organizational contacts, devices, service principals, and other groups as members.

NOTE: 

- Currently, the MGDC platform ONLY supports extracting groups which have at least one valid user. Trying to extract groups not having any such valid user will result in pipelines failing with the error that none of the users requested were valid. Valid users must have the following:
    * A valid mailbox (i.e. users having mailbox that is **not in inactive state**, **not soft-deleted** or **not hosted on-Prem**)
    * User account enabled (i.e. accountEnabled should not be set to false)
    * A valid substrate mailbox (i.e. it should have an exchange license)
- The MGDC platform supports extraction of data for all valid users matching with the ADF pipeline's region. Hence, if the users' mailbox are residing in different regions, then multiple pipelines will need to be triggered in the respective ADF regions. 

## Scenarios

The following are business scenarios that you can answer with this dataset:

- Generate a list of the members of a group.
- Determine whether a user is a member of a group.

## Questions

The following are examples of questions that you can answer with this dataset:

- How many members are part of a particular group?
- Who are the members of a group?

## Joining with other datasets

The GroupMembers_v0 dataset can be joined with the GroupDetails_v0 and GroupOwners_v0 datasets.

## Definitions

- Groups are collections of principals with shared access to resources in Microsoft services or in your app. Different principals such as users, other groups, devices, and applications can be part of groups. Using groups helps users avoid working with individual principals and simplifies management of access to user resources.
- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) supports the following types of groups.
  - Microsoft 365 groups
  - Security groups
  - Mail-enabled security groups
  - Distribution groups
- Only Microsoft 365 and security groups can be managed by the tenant users. Mail-enabled security groups and distribution groups are read-only through Microsoft Graph.
