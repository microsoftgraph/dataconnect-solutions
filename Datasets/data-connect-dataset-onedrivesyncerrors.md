## BasicDataSet_v0.OneDriveSyncErrors_v0 dataset

### Description: 

The OneDrive Sync Errors dataset includes information about errors on devices running OneDrive for Business. This includes one object for every type of error in a specific device. Data includes error codes, error messages and number of times an error was seen on the device. 

### Scenarios:

- Users can experience sync errors affecting productivity and collaboration. Administrators want to identify devices that are both experiencing errors and not staying up-to-date and want to drill down into report details to understand the users’ states.
- Administrators want to know which specific errors are occurring on each device in the organization.
- Administrators want to understand which types of error are most common.  

### Questions:

- How many devices are showing errors?
- Which types of errors are making most devices unhealthy?
- Which devices are showing a specific error?
- What are the errors occurring on a specific device?

### Joining with other datasets:

- This dataset can be joined with the Sync Health dataset (by OneDriveDeviceId) to provide device and user details.

### Definitions:

- Device – A computer (PC or Mac) running the OneDrive Sync client to upload and download files to the cloud.

### Error codes:
