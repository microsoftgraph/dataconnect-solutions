# TeamsChannelDetails_v0 dataset

The TeamsChannelDetails_v0 dataset provides a list of Microsoft Teams channels. Teams in Microsoft Teams are made up of channels, which are the conversations that users have with their teammates. Each channel is dedicated to a specific topic, department, or project. 

Channels are where the work actually gets done; where text, audio, and video conversations open to the whole team happen; where files are shared; and where tabs are added. TeamsChannelDetails dataset provides details of all the conversation channels created on Microsoft Teams for a particular tenant.

NOTE: 

- The MGDC platform supports extraction of data for all valid users matching with the ADF pipeline's region. Hence, if the users' mailbox are residing in different regions, then multiple pipelines will need to be triggered in the respective ADF regions. 

## Scenarios

The following are business scenarios that you can answer with this dataset:

- Analyze Microsoft Teams channels that are created in a particular time range.
- Analyze all the web URLs of all the channels for a security audit of an organization.

## Questions

- How many Microsoft Teams channels are created for a tenant?
- When (date and time) was a particular channel created?
- What are all the names of all the channels that exist for a tenant?
- What are all the web URLs created for all existing channels for a tenant?
- What are all the email addresses for all existing channels for a tenant?

## Definitions

A team in Microsoft Teams is a collection of channel objects. A channel represents a topic, and therefore a logical isolation of discussion, within a team. Every team is associated with a Microsoft 365 group. Groups have the same ID as the team name; for example, /groups/{id}/team is the same as /teams/{id}.
