# Set up your Azure Active Directory App registration

In this exercise you will create, run, and approve an Azure Data Factory pipeline to extract data from Microsoft 365 to an Azure Storage Blob for additional processing.

## Create a Microsoft Azure Active Directory application registration

The first step is to create an Azure AD application that will be used as the security principal to run the data extraction process.

1. Open a browser and go to your [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Sign in using an account with **Global administrator** rights to your Azure and Microsoft 365 tenants.

1. On the sidebar navigation, select **Azure Active Directory** (Azure AD).

1. On the Azure AD Overview page, select **App registrations** from the **Manage** section of the menu.

1. Select the **New registration** button.

1. Use the following values to create a new Azure AD application and select **Register**.

   - **Name**: Microsoft Graph Data Connect Data Transfer
   - **Supported account types**: Accounts in this organizational directory only.
   - **Redirect URI**: Leave the default values.

1. Locate the **Application (client) ID** and copy it as you will need it later in this tutorial. This will be referred to as the service principal ID.

1. Locate the **Directory (tenant) ID** and copy it as you will need it later in this tutorial. This will be referred to as the tenant ID.

1. On the sidebar navigation, select **Certificates and secrets** under **Manage**.

1. Select the **New client secret button**. Set *Description* to any name, set **Expires** to any value in the dropdown and choose **Add**.

    - After the client secret is created, make sure you save the **Value** somewhere safe, as it will no longer be available later, and you will need to create a new one.
    - This will be referenced as the service principal key.

1. On the sidebar navigation for the application, select **Owners**.

1. Verify that your account is listed as an owner for the application. If it isn't listed as an owner, add it.
