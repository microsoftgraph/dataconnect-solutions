There are 3 steps that are executed in the backend in order to obtain the enriched information in the mails and
employees indexes.

- profiles_enrichment_processor.py
- mail_enrichment_processor.py
- mail_role_detection_taxo.py

Profile enrichment scripts are using the following steps:
- the data is being read from the azure sql database
- for the content,skills,about_me,topics the following steps are being used:
    - the content is being tokenized, and the stopwords are being removed
    - from the tokenized words we build: bigrams,trigrams, and we extract the lemmas
    - we iterate through our list of words:
        - for each domain_enrichment we check for the term presence in that domain vocabulary
        - if the term is being found, the associated words are being retrieved
        - for the corresponding domain we collect the associated words

The same steps are being used for the mail processing, except here the input data is read from AZBS.

The output of the processing pipeline will contain the original fields plus associated de_ _domain_ fields.

**Example Processing pipeline**

```
Input - about_me field:

"I'm a Development Lead with 12 years of experience (4 in this role). I use Excel and Adobe. I have a Bachelors Degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Washington. I am married with a daughter (8) and 2 sons (2 and 9). I have a cat. I go snow-boarding, I like to work out at the gym, and I play basketball with my friends. I like Rap music. I love movies (especially SciFi, Horror, and Disaster). . Development Lead"


Output - about_me field:
"development,lead,experience,years,experience,role,excel,adobe,bachelor,degree,bachelor degree,university,civil engineering, civil,engineering..."

Input - skills field:
"microsoft visual studio 2017,project management,deep learning,service bus,python,hadoop,content management,spark structured streaming"

Output - skills field:
"microsoft visual studio, visual studio, project management,project,management,deep learning,service bus,python,hadoop,content,content management,spark,spark structured streaming"

Input - responsibilities field:
"rapidsai,analyst,chemistry,nvidia jetson,architecture,image segmentation,functional analysis,flow"

Output - responsibilities field:
"rapidsai,analyst,chemistry,nvidia,nvidia jetson,architecture,image,segmentation,image segmentation,functional,analysis,functional analysis,flow"
```

Once the keywords from the input text are extracted, we feed them to our skills enrichment models.

TODO: review the list of the taxonomy
(For the moment we have several profile enrichment models for different domains: Software Engineering, Data
Science,Legal,Finance,Facilities,Human Resources,Sales and Marketing)

The output will look like the following:

**Assumptions**: *the extracted associated words can be used as indicators for a possible person skill.*


------------

**Role Inference**

The role detection pipeline is making use of a custom model. 
For each user present in the system, all their mails are being aggregated.

For each mail belonging to a user:
- the mail is being split in fragments.
- for each fragment a role (and an associated score) is being assigned to that fragment
- once the roles were collected for the mail content:
- we extract the most common role, the role with the highest score
- all this information is computed again after processing all the mails for the given user
