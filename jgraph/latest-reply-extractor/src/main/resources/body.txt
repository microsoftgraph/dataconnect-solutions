OK Kevin, count me in for Agenda Item No. 5. Please advise as to the scope and
nature of the desired components for this Agenda Item, or perhaps pass my offer
along to Orlando and we can then work together to ensure a high quality panel /
presentation to cover the ""New Supply Sources""...... wayne

Talk to you soon............... wayne

Hi Wayne, thanks for the reply.  It would be great if you could develop
something for item 5.  I think Orlando Alvarado is having difficulty
getting anyone from Williams signed up for it.  As for item 6, I may
have an interested party for that one but I'll keep you posted.

thanks again,
kh

Kevin, we have not yet had the opportunity to meet as I have not been
able to
make it to the Committee meetings as Carrie had set-up. Taking a look at
the
Agenda, I can probably help with items 5 or 6 and would be happy to
develop and
deliver a presentation or would ensure that a senior representative from
Enbridge would do that. My natural tendency (with my current position in
Northern Pipeline Development) would be towards the Agenda Item No. 5
(New
Supply  Sources), but I probably could find a good resource within
Enbridge to
present some views and thinking on the Infrastructure De-bottlenecking
item.

Please let me know what you think............ wayne

I look forward to the Conference and to getting a chance to meet you.

- Natural Gas Infrastructure Committee






Hi everyone!!

           For those of you I haven't met personnally, my name is Kevin
Hyatt.  I am currently chairing the Natural Gas Infrastructure
subcommittee for the Electric Power Conference 2002 to be held in March.
You are receiving this email because you have previously expressed an
interest in serving on the committee.

Attached below is the current subcommittee track agenda with the 4
sessions and each session's speaking topics.  The track and topics were
developed over the last 3 months with various inputs from committee
members and the Trade Fair Group staff.

Our current challenge is finding speakers for items 1, 6, and 15
(highlighted in red).  If you move your cursor over the topic, the
comment box will appear outlining in a little better detail what info we
are trying to present for the conference attendees.

I am working on lining up several speakers but as of yet have only
confirmed one from Calpine.  What I need each of you to do is review the
agenda, think about who you may know who would be a good speaker for the
topic, then call them to see if they are interested.  Speeches should
last no more than 30 minutes with a Q&A period afterward.

If possible, please email or call me with your results by Friday 10/26.
Interested speakers will receive a formal invitation from the Trade Fair
Group confirming their attendance.

Thanks for your help.  Don't hesitate to call me (713-853-5559) or
Carrie Shapiro (713-463-9595 x307) with any questions!!
