## Notes

- SharedWith fields refer to a person or group with whom a resource is being shared with.
- In a later release, we will offer a “Sites” data set which can be joined to this “Sharing” data set by Site Id. In the meantime, ItemURL is offered to help understand where the item is being shared.  
- The “Shared With Count” property is useful if you decide to exclude the “Shared With” column from the data set for privacy reasons.
- The "Operation" property is related to the Full or Delta Mode. Please refer to the examples below.   
    1. To get a full snapshot, please ensure that start and end date are the SAME date       
        - Start date: 1/1/2023       
        - End date: 1/1/2023       
        - User receives one full snapshot of data for that day (1/1/2023).       
        - For all objects, the Operation will be “Full”    

    2. To get a Delta snapshot, with only the objects that were created/updated/delete. Please ensure the start date and end date are different and the start date is before the end date.       
        - Start date: 1/1/2023       
        - End date: 1/3/2023       
        - User receives objects that were created, updated or deleted in this time period. If no rows are returned, there were no changes during this time period.        
        - For each object, the Operation will be “Created”, “Updated” or “Deleted”.
