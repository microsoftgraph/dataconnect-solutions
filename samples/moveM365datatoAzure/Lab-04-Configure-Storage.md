# Set up your Azure Storage resource

In this step you will create an Azure Storage account where Microsoft Graph data connect will store the data extracted from Microsoft 365 for further processing.

1. Open a browser and go to your [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Sign in using an account with **Global administrator** rights to your Azure and Microsoft 365 tenants.

1. On the sidebar navigation, select **Create a resource**.

1. Find the **Storage Account** resource type and use the following values to create it, then select **Review + create**.

    - **Subscription**: select your Azure subscription
    - **Resource group**: GraphDataConnect (or select an existing resource group)
    - **Storage account name**: mgdcm365datastore
    - **Region**: pick an Azure region in the same region as your Microsoft 365 region
    - **Performance**: Standard
    - **Redundancy**: Geo-redundant storage (GRS)
    - **Advanced tab**:
      - **Access tier**: Hot

1. Review that the settings match those shown in the previous step and select **Create**.

1. After the Azure Storage account has been created, grant the Azure AD application previously created the proper access to it.

    1. Select the **Azure Storage account**.
    2. On the sidebar menu, select **Access control (IAM)**.
    3. Select the **Add** button in the **Add a role assignment** block.
    4. Use the following values to find the application you previously selected to grant it the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role, then select **Save**.

        - **Role**: Storage Blob Data Contributor
        - **Assign access to**: User, group or service principal
        - **Select**: Microsoft Graph data connect Data Transfer (the name of the Azure AD application you created previously)
